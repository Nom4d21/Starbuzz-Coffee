            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>
                "A man, a plan, and a coffee bean." Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good
                cup of coffee. Stabuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: A Starbuzz on every corner.

            <p>
                In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere. And
                ofcourse, the big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's
                Web presence, whichh is growig rapidly and helping to meet caffeinated needs of a whole new set of
                customers.
